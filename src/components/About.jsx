        <p>Experienced Front-End developer. I've been working in this field more than 20 years 
            and remember days without div mark-up :).
            Love Javascript, HTML and CSS magic. 
            Know vueJS, jQuery, lodash, Node.js, etc., learn React, 
            but prefer vanilla javascript. 
            <br/>
            What I don't know I can learn.
